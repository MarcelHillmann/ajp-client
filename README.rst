======================================
A client for the Apache JServ Protocol
======================================

I've often wanted a Java client for AJP_, but never found one.  So
while waiting for a maintenance window to roll around at work, I
finally wrote one.

Yes, I know the code is horrible; yes, I know there is no
documentation.  Both of those things can be fixed in time.

 Boring legal stuff
